Electron Microscopy Data Ingestion Pipeline
==============================================
Pipeline started at: 2025-06-11 17:17:51
Setting up directories...
Using configuration: ./config/config.yaml
Data will be stored in: ./data
Pipeline orchestration logs will be stored in: ./logs
Orchestration mode: background

Background Processing Strategy:
  EPFL starts in background (6GB/1.0CPU)
  Small loaders run sequentially (IDR → FlyEM → EBI, ~1-1.5GB each)
  OpenOrganelle starts after small loaders complete (8GB/2.0CPU)
  Total Peak Usage: ~12-14GB memory, optimized throughput
  Optimized for: Maximum efficiency with memory safety
