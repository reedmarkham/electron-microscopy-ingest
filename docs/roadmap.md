## Roadmap: Evolution to API Service

### Current State (v2.0):
- JSON Schema validation and standardized metadata structure
- Centralized configuration management with YAML
- Enhanced consolidation tool with validation reporting
- Standardized status tracking across all data sources
- Programmatic metadata management library

### Next Phase (v3.0):
The current file-based metadata system will evolve into a modern API service with the following capabilities:

**Planned Architecture:**
- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- **REST/GraphQL API**: Programmatic access to metadata catalog
- **Search & Discovery**: vector database integration for advanced querying
- **Policy Engine**: Automated data governance and compliance rules
- **Quality Gates**: Real-time data quality monitoring and alerting
