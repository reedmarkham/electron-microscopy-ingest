## Roadmap: Evolution to Catalog API Service

### Current State (v2.0)
- JSON Schema validation and standardized metadata structure
- Centralized configuration management with YAML
- Enhanced consolidation tool with validation reporting
- Standardized status tracking across all data sources
- Programmatic metadata management library

### Next Phase (v3.0): API Service Architecture
The current file-based metadata system will evolve into a **modern catalog API service** with the following capabilities:

**Planned Architecture:**
- **REST/GraphQL API**: Programmatic access to metadata catalog
- **Event-Driven Pipelines**: Real-time metadata updates via Kafka/Redis streams
- **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- **Search & Discovery**: Elasticsearch integration for advanced querying
- **Data Lineage**: Graph-based tracking of dataset relationships and processing history
- **Policy Engine**: Automated data governance and compliance rules
- **Quality Gates**: Real-time data quality monitoring and alerting

**Migration Strategy:**
- **Phase 1**: Hybrid mode with both file-based and API access
- **Phase 2**: API-first with file system as cache layer  
- **Phase 3**: Full event-driven architecture with real-time processing

**Integration Points:**
- Data source scripts will transition from file-based metadata writing to API calls
- Event streaming for real-time pipeline monitoring and status updates
- Webhook integration for external system notifications
- OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas for standardized integration

This foundation ensures smooth migration to a state-of-the-art metadata catalog platform while maintaining backward compatibility and operational continuity.
